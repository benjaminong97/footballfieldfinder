# Summary
### Project One-Liner 
This is a map application meant for users to easily find sports facilities in their vicinity. It displays information on mainly ActiveSG and football/futsal facilities.
### Context and Justification
There is no comprehensive place where Singaporeans can find a consolidated display of sports facilities near them. 

For example, the ActiveSG does not have a map integrated into their application nor is there a location search function (there is only a 'near me' function which uses the device location). In addition to this, there are several companies which offer futsal and football facilities in Singapore at the same time having no comprehensive list of all their locations. Hence, at the current moment it is troublesome for Singaporeans to browse and find facilities they may use in a specific region in Singapore. 

This map app aims to fill this gap, allowing users to search and filter ActiveSG and futsal facilities in a specific region, using the map to give them a good idea of what is on offer in that area. 

# 5 Planes of Design 
## Target audience group:
### Singaporeans who want to get into sports but do not know where to start/ find facilities.
**Age:** 13 onwards 

**Fitness level:** Any

**IT Literacy Level:** Able to use smartphone/ computer and basic applications such as Google maps

**Goals:** 
Finding sports facilities and getting information about it easily. 

**Considerations:**
Users need to know basic information such as the facilities on offer, and any links which can be used for booking/ finding more information. 

### Singaporeans who are into football who wish to find facilities around the country
**Age:** 13 onwards

**Fitness level:** Any

**IT Literacy Level:** Able to use smartphone/ computer and basic applications such as Google maps

**Goals:**
Finding futsal/ football facilities which they may have been unaware of previously. 

**Considerations:**
Users need to know what courts are on offer (ie 5 a side, 11 a side) and the booking page of the facility. 

### Singaporeans who wish to find ActiveSG facilities on a map
**Age:** 13 onwards 

**Fitness level:** Any

**IT Literacy Level:** Able to use smartphone/ computer and basic applications such as Google maps

**Goals:**

## UI/UX:
### User Stories
- As a working (in a non-technical field) adult with little time and no prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies, I want to learn more about them so that I can decide whether to invest in them.
Acceptance Criteria
Quick and succinct in knowledge delivery
Non-technical, gentle introduction of jargon

- As an adult who has heard much negative news about cryptocurrencies but didnâ€™t do any prior read-up, I want to open my mind once again to them so that I understand why some of my friends are so upbeat about cryptocurrencies. 
Acceptance Criteria
Dispel negative myths in a transparent manner
Non-biased delivery of information
Non pushy narrative

- As an adult who has already bought cryptocurrencies, I think I know plenty about cryptocurrencies. I want to see if there is anything more I can learn so that I can broaden my knowledge
Acceptance Criteria
Delving into technical aspects which most people rarely touch
Delving into more exotic topics

### Special considerations:
Due to the jurisdiction in which the website is created in, there should be no financial advice whatsoever. 
## Content & Features:

### Webpages

- ### Index Page
A way to access all 6 webpages from the landing page. 

- ### History
A discussion about the history of bitcoin in vertical timeline format, with a nice big price chart of Bitcoin being the anchor. The price chart can toggle between logarithmic, and candle, and also varying timespans. 

- ### Security
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) arranged in slide style, with examples on hashing, digital signatures, wallet generation and blockchain simulation. However, due to lack of time, this section is unable to be completed past digital signatures. 

- ### Scarcity
A discussion about mining and the circulating supply of Bitcoin, with an anchor supply chart at the top, zoomable, and with a reset zoom feature. Tables comparing the difference between Bitcoin and Gold

- ### Decentralization
An anchor map that lists all of the active Bitcoin nodes currently active, and discusses why does running nodes contribution to decentralization. The map should be able to cluster nodes based on human geography. 
- ### Dashboard
A one-stop dashboard that allows users to view handy data about Bitcoin. Resizable widgets that can be dragged and dropped in any configuration the user wants for their own specific needs. Widgets can also be closed. If the user ever needs to reset the layout, there is a reset button.
